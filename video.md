Hello, Every One! This is Spark!
Spark是基于ICP链构建的的去中心化全链文档协同管理平台、知识共享平台。
大多文档协同平台无法避免安全和隐私泄漏问题，并且为了商业化，指定梯度、功能、会员制等多种收费机制，使用户想要体验产品话费产生很多不必要支出。
Spark依靠ICP的特性和我们的愿景，Spark为用户提供更好的匿名性、数据安全性。产品完全按需使用，不设置梯度收费，不会恶意收集用户数据。

历史上有很多明星产品，还有用户但因为盈利或者立场问题，抛弃用户关停产品。Spark计划正式运营后交由社区管理维护，并且产品完全上链，不用担心关停风险，目前仅ICP能够实现这一愿景。

关于如何使用可以参考视频简介中的用户手册，我们的网址：https://ic-spark.app

Hello, Every One! This is Spark!
Spark is a decentralized full-chain document collaboration management platform and knowledge sharing platform built on the ICP chain.
Most document collaboration platforms cannot avoid security and privacy leakage issues, and for commercialization, they specify various charging mechanisms such as gradients, functions, and membership systems, which make users want to experience the product and incur a lot of unnecessary expenses.
Spark relies on the characteristics of ICP and our vision to provide users with better anonymity and data security. The product is completely used on demand, without setting gradient charges, and will not maliciously collect user data.

There have been many star products in history, and there are users, but because of profit or position issues, users are abandoned and products are shut down. Spark plans to be managed and maintained by the community after the official operation, and the product is fully on the chain, without worrying about the risk of shutdown. Currently, only ICP can realize this vision.
